> The fastest way to explore, select and concatenate files from your terminal.

![Demo](demo.gif)


Cat Selector is an interactive terminal tool for browsing, selecting, concatenating, and exporting text content in files and directories, combining multiple actions into a single seamless flow.

## Why Cat Selector?

- True multi-selection across directories and files.
- Instant generation and single concatenated text output.

A direct, visual, and straight-forward content selector and concatenated text file exporter.

- **Split Navigation**: Divided panels for directory, file navigation and file and subdirectories preview.
- **Multiple Selection**: Quick selection of multiple files and subdirectories
- **Concatenation**: Combine selected content into a single output.

  - Export to temporary file
  - Direct clipboard copying
